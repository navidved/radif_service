# Go Project Structure

- Follow standard Go layout: `cmd/` for binaries, `internal/` for private packages.
- Layered architecture: `handler` → `service` → `repository` → `db`. Each layer imports only the layer directly below it.
- Interfaces are defined where they are USED, not where they are implemented.
- All exported types and functions must have a Go doc comment.
- Keep `main.go` thin: wire dependencies, start server, handle OS signals for graceful shutdown.
- No `init()` functions except in blank-import driver packages.
- No global mutable state; pass dependencies via constructor injection (NewX(deps) pattern).
